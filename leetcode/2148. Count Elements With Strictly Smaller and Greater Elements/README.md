## 2148. Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements

`Easy`

<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, return <em>the number of elements that have <strong>both</strong> a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in </em><code>nums</code>.</p>

---

### Examples


**Input**
```
nums = [11,7,2,15]
```

**Output**
```
2
```

**Explanation**
```
The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Input**
```
nums = [-3,3,3,90]
```

**Output**
```
2
```

**Explanation**
```
The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Constraints**

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>
