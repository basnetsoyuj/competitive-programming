## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

`Easy`

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.

**Constraints**

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>
