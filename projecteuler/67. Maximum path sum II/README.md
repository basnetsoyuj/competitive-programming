## 67. Maximum path sum II

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=67](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67)

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

<pre>
    <b>3</b>
   <b>7</b> 4
  2 <b>4</b> 6
 8 5 <b>9</b> 3
</pre>

That is, `3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23`.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](p067_triangle.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**NOTE**: This is a much more difficult version of [Problem 18](../18.%20Maximum%20path%20sum%20I/). It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
